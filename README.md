# CodeLess
A simple web based static site generator!
## About
Hello, Folks!! Codeless is a kind of static site generator it converts markdown to HTML and allows you to download the converted HTML with some default styles. Codeless uses the [github markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) flavour. So all you have to do is enter your markdown in the editor above and preview the HTML in the preview tab and that's it done you can download the HTML file!!. Under the hood we use the [showdown.js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown)(an open source JS library) to convert markdown to HTML. So, the project is beginner-friendly so feel free to contribute. Hope you all
:heart: this!!
